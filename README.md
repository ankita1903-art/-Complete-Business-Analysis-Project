Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Strategy

An end-to-end Business Data Analysis Project focused on understanding customer churn behavior and providing data-driven retention strategies.
🎯 Project Objective: Customer churn directly impacts revenue and growth. This project aims to:
Identify key factors driving customer churn
Predict customers at risk of leaving
Segment customers based on behavior
Provide actionable business recommendations
This project demonstrates data analytics, statistics, machine learning, and business strategy integration.

🧩 Business Problem: Customer acquisition is expensive. When customers leave (churn), companies lose recurring revenue and must spend more to replace them.
Key Questions Addressed:
Why are customers churning?
Which customers are likely to churn?
What strategies can reduce churn?

🛠 Technical Approach
1️⃣ Data Preparation: Missing value handling
Data type corrections
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Removal of non-informative columns (Customer ID)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Churn distribution analysis
Categorical feature relationships
Numerical feature trends
Correlation analysis
Multivariate visualizations

3️⃣ Advanced Analysis: Technique	Purpose
Hypothesis Testing	Validate impact of pricing on churn
Logistic Regression	Predict churn probability
K-Means Clustering	Segment customers by behavior

📊 Key Visualizations: Churn distribution chart
Contract type vs churn
Monthly charges boxplot
Tenure distribution histogram
Correlation heatmap
Tenure vs Monthly charges scatter plot

🔍 Key Insights
Finding	Business Meaning
Short tenure → high churn	Weak onboarding
Month-to-month contracts risky	Low customer commitment
Higher monthly charges → churn	Price sensitivity
New customers most vulnerable	Early engagement needed

💡 Business Recommendations
Introduce structured onboarding programs
Offer discounts for long-term contracts
Provide targeted retention offers to high-risk customers
Use predictive model to identify churn-prone users

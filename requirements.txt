Project Title: Customer Churn Business Analysis Project
🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to conduct a complete end-to-end business data analysis to identify the key drivers of customer churn and provide data-driven strategies to improve customer retention and business profitability.

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics, statistics, machine learning, and business strategy in solving a real-world business problem.

🧩 Business Problem

Customer churn leads to revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Businesses must understand why customers leave and develop proactive retention strategies.

This project answers:

What factors influence customer churn?

Which customers are at high risk of leaving?

How can the business reduce churn using data insights?
